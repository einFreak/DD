2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell countSEG_reg[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) countSEG_reg[0]/CLR, countSEG_reg[1]/CLR, countSEG_reg[2]/CLR, countSEG_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RESET relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch countSEG_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin countSEG_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch countSEG_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin countSEG_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch countSEG_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin countSEG_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch countSEG_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin countSEG_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
